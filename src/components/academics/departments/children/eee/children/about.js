				<p className="page-body">
					The Electrical & Electronics Engineering department is part of BPIT since its inception. The department offers B.Tech. 
					in Electrical & Electronics Engineering Program with an annual intake of 60 students. B.Tech. Programme Electrical & 
					Electronics Engineering got accreditation from National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in Dec 2017.
					Electrical energy is one of the most important inventions of the last century. As the electrical energy is one of the 
					most important requirements of one and all in whole of the world, its growing demand warrants new innovations for 
					enhanced production, efficient transmission and management. These require quality engineers, therefore, the department of 
					Electrical & Electronics Engineering is grooming the youth through className-room teaching, laboratory practices and field 
					visits to take new challenges in the area of Electrical & Electronics Engineering.
